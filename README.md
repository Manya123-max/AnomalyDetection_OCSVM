# Anomaly Detection using One-Class SVM

## Introduction
Anomaly detection is the identification of rare events, items, or observations which differ significantly from the majority of the data. This project utilizes a One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for anomaly detection. One-Class SVM is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for this purpose.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

## Usage
To use the anomaly detection model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script (if any) to prepare the data for training.
3. Train the model using the provided script.
4. Evaluate the model using the test dataset.
